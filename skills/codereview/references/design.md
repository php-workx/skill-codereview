**Why explorer-judge instead of independent passes:**
- Explorers use `sonnet` (fast, good at search) — cheaper and faster for investigation
- The judge uses the default model (thorough) — better for synthesis and verdict
- Explorers can use tools (Grep/Read/Glob) to deeply investigate their area
- The judge sees all findings together, resolving conflicts and removing duplicates
- Total context pressure is lower: each explorer only handles one specialty

**Why enriched prompts with calibration examples:**
- Thin prompts produce thin findings — explorers need concrete examples of what "good" looks like
- Calibration examples anchor severity and confidence scores to specific evidence levels
- False positive suppression lists dramatically reduce noise from common non-issues
- Chain-of-thought investigation phases ensure explorers investigate systematically instead of pattern-matching

**Why adversarial validation in the judge:**
- Explorers over-report by design (optimizing for recall)
- The judge optimizes for precision — every finding that survives should be real
- Contradiction checks catch the most common false positives: "missing null check" when a guard exists upstream, "N+1 query" when the ORM eager-loads, etc.
- Root cause grouping prevents the same issue from being reported 3 times by different explorers

**Why adaptive pass selection:**
- Running a concurrency pass on a CSS change wastes time and produces noise
- Running an API/contract pass on internal refactoring wastes time
- Core passes always run because correctness, security, reliability, and test coverage are always relevant
- Extended passes are specialized enough that skip signals can reliably determine relevance

## Design Rationale

| Decision | Why | Source |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Explorer-judge architecture | Specialized sub-agents investigate deeply, judge synthesizes and validates | Vibe/council explorer pattern, context window management |
| Enriched prompts with CoT phases | Thin prompts produce thin findings; structured investigation ensures depth | v1 experience: shallow findings with 16-line prompts |
| Calibration examples in each prompt | Anchor severity/confidence to specific evidence levels | v1 experience: inconsistent severity calibration |
| False positive suppression lists | Dramatically reduces noise from common non-issues | v1 experience: frequent false alarms on parameterized SQL, auto-escaped HTML, etc. |
| Adversarial judge validation | Explorers optimize for recall, judge optimizes for precision | Council/debate pattern: disagreement reveals signal |
| Root cause grouping in judge | Prevent duplicate reports when multiple explorers flag symptoms of the same issue | v1 experience: 3 explorers reporting the same null check bug |
| Extended passes (error-handling, api-contract, concurrency) | These are distinct concern areas that deserve specialized investigation | v1 gap: error swallowing buried in reliability pass, API contracts buried in correctness |
| Adaptive pass selection | Avoid running irrelevant passes — saves time and reduces noise | Skip signals based on diff content: no concurrency primitives → skip concurrency pass |
| Configurable model per pass | Security and concurrency benefit from stronger models; test adequacy is fine with faster models | Model cost/quality tradeoff differs by pass complexity |
| Complexity analysis in context | Feed radon/gocyclo scores to AI so it flags high-complexity functions | Vibe skill complexity step |
| Language standards (optional) | Give explorers concrete language-specific rules; graceful degradation if not installed | Vibe/standards skill two-tier system |
| Dead code / YAGNI check | Avoid reviewing and fixing unused code — waste of agent time | receiving-code-review YAGNI pattern |
| Spec/plan comparison | Check implementation completeness against requirements | requesting-code-review plan comparison |
| Dedicated spec-verification pass | Requirement extraction, implementation tracing, and test category classification need deep investigation that doesn't fit in the judge's synthesis role | v1 gap: judge did shallow keyword matching, no test category awareness |
| Test category classification (unit/integration/e2e) | Knowing a test exists is not enough — knowing what *kind* of test it is determines if the right failure modes are caught | User need: DB interaction tested only with mocks misses schema drift |
| Per-requirement traceability (spec_requirements) | Flat spec_gaps list says what's missing but not what's covered or how — structured output enables downstream tooling and tracking | User need: verify spec section-by-section with evidence |
| --spec-scope flag | Large specs cover many features; scoping avoids context pollution and irrelevant "not implemented" noise | User need: verify specific milestone or section against diff |
| Merge verdict (PASS/WARN/FAIL) | Clear ship/no-ship signal for humans and downstream agents | Vibe/council verdict pattern, requesting-code-review assessment |
| Strengths section | Acknowledge good patterns — review isn't just finding faults | requesting-code-review strengths output |
| Configurable pushback level | fix-all for agent workflows, cautious for human review | User feedback: agents should fix most issues, but not rabbit-hole |
| Configurable review cadence | pre-commit for quality-critical, wave-end for throughput | User request: some projects need every-commit review |
| Next Steps with fix ordering | Guide downstream agents on what to fix and in what order | receiving-code-review implementation ordering |
| Deterministic scans before AI | Run semgrep/trivy/osv-scanner/sonarqube first so AI skips restating their findings | Previous plan, playbook 4-stage pipeline |
| Comprehensive findings (no hard cap) | Code agents fix fast — surface everything actionable, let tiers prioritize | Agent-assisted workflow reality |
| Action tiers (Must/Should/Consider) | Structured prioritization without losing lower-severity findings | Replaces rigid comment budget |
| Confidence floor (0.65) | Dramatically reduces false positives | Playbook signal controls |
| Structured JSON + Markdown output | JSON for machine consumption and validation; Markdown for humans | Global contract schema |
| Envelope metadata in artifacts | run_id/timestamp/scope/tool_status/verdict make reviews traceable | Previous plan |
| Best-effort degradation | Skip unavailable tools with explicit status rather than failing | Previous plan |
| Repo-level config file | Teams customize passes, cadence, pushback, paths, thresholds | CodeRabbit `.coderabbit.yaml`, Gemini `config.yaml` |
| Historical risk scoring | Git log churn + bug frequency provides a per-file risk signal. Files with recent bug history get extra explorer attention. | Complements path-based risk heuristics with data-driven signal |

## Large Changeset Support (Chunked Review Mode)

For diffs exceeding 80 files or 8000 lines, the standard pipeline hits context window limits — each explorer receives the entire diff (~40-80k tokens) plus context, leaving insufficient room for investigation. The chunked review mode transparently scales the review by splitting files into groups and using a single final judge.

### Architecture

```
Step 1:    Determine review target (unchanged)
                │
Step 1.5:  Mode selection + Diff triage + File clustering
           ├─ Count files/lines → decide standard vs chunked mode
           ├─ Build changeset manifest (risk tiers per file)
           ├─ Cluster files into chunks (8-15 files, max 2000 diff lines)
           └─ Write full diff to temp file (protect orchestrator context)
                │
Step 2-L:  Tiered context gathering
           ├─ Phase A: lightweight global context (~5k tokens)
           │   ├─ Import graph, dead code (new functions only)
           │   └─ Complexity hotspots (C+ only), standards, spec
           └─ Phase B: chunk-scoped deep context (per chunk, ~10-15k)
               ├─ Callers/callees (top 5/3 per function)
               └─ Types, test files
                │
Step 3:    Deterministic scans (unchanged, output scoped per chunk)
                │
Step 3.5:  Adaptive pass selection (per chunk, not global)
                │
Step 4-L:  Chunked AI review
           │
           ├─ 4-L.2: Chunked explorers (waves of 8-12 parallel Tasks)
           │   ├─ Wave 1: All passes × Tier 1 (critical) chunks
           │   ├─ Wave 2: Core passes × Tier 2 (standard) chunks
           │   └─ Wave 3: Extended passes × Tier 2 + Tier 3 chunks
           │   (Spec verification runs as single global pass with full diff)
           │
           ├─ 4-L.3: Cross-chunk synthesizer (single agent)
           │   └─ Interface mismatches, data flow, consistency, shared resources
           │   └─ Receives actual diff content at chunk boundaries
           │
           └─ 4-L.4: Final judge (full adversarial validation)
               └─ Same rigor as standard mode, cross-chunk root cause grouping, verdict
                │
Steps 5-7: Merge, format (+ chunk summary table), save
```

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| High activation thresholds (80 files / 8000 lines) | Modern models handle large contexts well. Only chunk when truly necessary to avoid information loss from context fragmentation. Raised from 30/3000 after testing showed chunking hurt quality on medium-sized diffs. |
| Directory-based clustering | Deterministic, no AI required, strong proxy for file relatedness. |
| Three-tier risk tiering (Critical / Standard / Low-risk) | Auth/payment files need deeper review than config files. Prioritizes explorer attention where risk is highest. |
| Single final judge (no chunk judges) | Chunk judges created multi-level filtering that removed real findings. A single final judge with full adversarial validation preserves recall while maintaining precision. Explorers optimize for recall, judge optimizes for precision — one gate, not three. |
| Cross-chunk synthesizer with actual diff content | Cross-file pattern detection needs its own context budget and tool access. Including actual diff at chunk boundaries (not just summaries) enables detection of type mismatches, interface changes, and data flow breaks. |
| Spec verification runs globally with full diff | Requirements span the entire changeset — fragmenting per chunk loses traceability. Full diff available via temp file enables behavioral verification, not just existence checks. |
| Wave batching (8-12 per wave) | Prevents spawning too many simultaneous sub-agents while maintaining parallelism. |
| Diff offloading to temp files | Prevents the orchestrator's own context from being consumed by a 40-80k token diff. |

### Tradeoffs

| Risk | Mitigation | Residual |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Cross-chunk bugs missed | Cross-chunk synthesizer with actual diff at boundaries + full adversarial validation in final judge | Medium: subtle interactions through unchanged code may be missed |
| Increased latency (~2-3x) | Highly parallel waves; serial overhead is only synthesizer + final judge | Acceptable: standard mode would fail on the same diff |
| Increased token cost (~2-4x) | Each explorer handles less work; without chunking, review is truncated/superficial | Acceptable tradeoff for quality |
| Final judge context pressure | All raw findings from all chunks sent to final judge | Mitigated by high activation thresholds (80/8000) limiting chunk count; judge can use tools to investigate |

## Future: Multi-Model Consensus (v2)

Running the same review across multiple models (e.g., Claude + Codex) and comparing their findings could significantly improve review quality. When two models independently flag the same issue, confidence is very high. When they disagree, the disagreement itself is a signal worth human attention.

Adversarial debate (where models review each other's findings and must steel-man opposing views before revising) is another promising direction — the council/vibe skills demonstrate this pattern works well.

These are areas to explore once the enriched single-model review is battle-tested.
